## Docker image for the Firefly III Data Importer

The Firefly III Data Importer Docker image is built [on Azure](https://dev.azure.com/Firefly-III/ImportToolImage/_wiki/wikis/MainImage.wiki/3/Home) and published [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fireflyiii/data-importer). There are several tags available:

* `fireflyiii/data-importer:latest`  
  The latest version. Will be stable.
* `fireflyiii/core:version-x.x.x`  
  A version tag, frozen to a specific patch version. Old version tags will be removed after about 6 months.

## docker-compose.yml

This repository also contains the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file which you can use to instantly run a version of Firefly III with a MariaDB (aka MySQL) database.

Some people use another database image instead of the provided database. This is entirely up to you of course, but make sure you change the environment variables if you switch away from MySQL or MariaDB.

### Docker and system architectures

The [database image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) provided by [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) may not provide the same system architectures as the [Firefly III image](https://hub.docker.com/r/fireflyiii/core/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated&name=latest) does. On system with a i386-architecture for example this means that Firefly III will run fine, but the provided database will not. Be aware that this may happen to you, although it's a rare occurence.
